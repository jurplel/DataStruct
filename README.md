# DataStruct
This is a repository containing my assignments for CIT245 Data Structures

## Team Optimizer
This is a tool that allows you to optimize a game development team based on years of experience and manual preferences.

## Data Model
This tool creates a vector of USB Device and times various sorting algorithms sorting the vector.

## Tree Model
This is a binary tree that holds the masses of celestial bodies. It has deleting, inserting, and printing capabilities.

## Search Tree
This project creates a universe with many planet objects, each of which have characteristics. The scenario then navigates through a search tree of the planets, searching for a planet that has desirable characteristics. 

This search tree has some issues with memory management, never goes up through the tree, and does not store the result in a vector of SearchTreeNode objects as it should.
